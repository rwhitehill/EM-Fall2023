\chapter{Maxwell Equations}

We have already derived the first of Maxwell's equations, which is just Gauss' law:
\begin{eqnarray}
    \div{\va*{E}} = \frac{\rho(\va*{r})}{\epsilon_0}
,\end{eqnarray}
derived from the integral form using the divergence theorem since the integral form is independent of the volume considered.
Actually, it will not need any alteration when we consider non-static electric fields: the flux generally only depends on the total charge enclosed by the surface bounding the volume.

The second of Maxwell's equations concerns the flux of the electric field.
Note that we can uniquely reconstruct a vector by simply knowing its curl and divergence.
Observe that 
\begin{align}
    \curl{\frac{\va*{r} - \va*{r}_{0}}{|\va*{r} - \va*{r}_{0}|^3}} &=  \grad{ \frac{1}{|\va*{r} - \va*{r}_{0}|^3} } \cross (\va*{r} - \va*{r}_{0}) + \frac{1}{|\va*{r} - \va*{r}_{0}|^3} \curl{(\va*{r} - \va*{r}_{0})} \\
                                                                   &= -\frac{3(\va*{r} - \va*{r}_{0})}{|\va*{r} - \va*{r}_{0}|^{5}} \cross (\va*{r} - \va*{r}_{0}) + 0 = 0
,\end{align}
and therefore
\begin{eqnarray}
    \label{eq:curl-E}
    \curl{\va*{E}} = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \int \dd[3]{\va*{r}'} \rho(\va*{r}') \curl{\frac{\va*{r} - \va*{r}'}{|\va*{r} - \va*{r}'|^3}} = 0
.\end{eqnarray}
One needs to take some caution though.
Unlike the first of Maxwell's equations, this second one will certainly change when we move past electrostatics and is a source of rich electrodynamic phenomena.
