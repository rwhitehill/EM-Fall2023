\sol{

(a) Solving this problem using the method of images, we place an image charge $-q$ on the other side of the plane a distance $d$ away.
The potential of this setup is
\begin{eqnarray}
    \Phi(\va*{r}) = \frac{q}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \Bigg( \frac{1}{|\va*{r} - d \vu*{e}_{z}|} - \frac{1}{|\va*{r} + d \vu*{e}_{z}|} \Bigg)
.\end{eqnarray}
We know that this is the correct potential since it satisfies Laplace's equation for $z > 0$ (defining the $z$-axis perpendicular to the plane and the $+$ direction pointing from the plane to the charge $q$) and the boundary conditions $\Phi(x,y,0) = 0$.

The relation between the potential and surface charge density is
\begin{eqnarray}
    \eqbox{
    \begin{aligned}
        \sigma &= \epsilon_0 \pdv{\Phi}{z} = \frac{q}{4 \pi} \pdv{z} \Bigg( \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z - d)^2}} - \frac{1}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (z + d)^2}} \Bigg)_{z = 0} \\
               &= \frac{q}{4 \pi} \Bigg( \frac{2 (z - d)}{[ x^2 + y^2 + (z - d)^2 ]^{3/2}} - \frac{2 (z + d)}{[ x^2 + y^2 + (z + d)^2 ]^{3/2}} \Bigg)_{z = 0} \\
               &= - \frac{qd}{\pi (\rho^2 + d^2)^{3/2}}
    ,\end{aligned}
}
\end{eqnarray}
where we have defined $\rho^2 = x^2 + y^2$.
Notice that the induced charge has an overall charge with sign opposite that of $q$.

   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{prob1a.pdf}
   \caption{\textbf{Left} -- Plot of surface charge density with respect to spatial variable $\rho = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ and \textbf{Right} -- Plot of surface charge density with respect to $(x,y)$ coordinates. Note that the spatial variables are in units of $d$, and furthermore, in the colormap plot on the right, one can intuitively read this to say that more charge aggregates directly below the charge $q$ and the distribution falls off radially from this center.}
   \label{fig:prob1a}
\end{figure}

(b) The force between the plane and point charge $q$ can be calcualted using Coulomb's law between $q$ and $-q$
\begin{eqnarray}
    \eqbox{ \va*{F} = - \frac{q^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{1}{2d^2} }
.\end{eqnarray}

(c) We can also calculate the total force acting on the plane as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
    \eqbox{
   \begin{aligned}
       F &= \int \frac{\sigma^2(x,y)}{2 \epsilon_0} \dd{x} \dd{y} = \frac{q^2 d^2}{2 \pi^2 \epsilon_0} \int_{0}^{2 \pi} \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{(\rho^2 + d^2)^{3/2}} \rho \dd{\rho} \dd{\phi} \\
         &= \Big( \frac{q d}{\pi} \Big)^2 \int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{\rho}{(\rho^2 + d^2)^{3/2}} \dd{\rho} = \frac{q^2 d}{\pi^2}
   .\end{aligned} 
}
\end{eqnarray}
Also, it should be clear that the force is attractive.

(d) From part(b), we can calculate the work needed to move the charge $q$ infinitely far from the plane as follows
\begin{eqnarray}
    W = \int_{d}^{\infty} \frac{q^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{1}{2 z^2} \dd{z} = \frac{q^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{1}{2 d}
.\end{eqnarray}
Note that the sign is correct since we have to apply a force opposing the attractive force between the plane and charge.

(e) The potential energy of the system can be computed as
\begin{eqnarray}
    U = q \Phi_{-}(d \vu*{e}_{z}) = - \frac{q^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \frac{1}{2 d}
,\end{eqnarray}
where $\Phi_{-}$ is the potential due to the image charge $-q$.
Observe that this expression says $U = -W$.
This is essentially just a statement of the conservation of mechanical energy.
The potential energy of the configuration is the negative of the work required to bring the charge $q$ to its position $d \vu*{e}_{z}$.

(f) For an electron ($q \approx 1.602 \times 10^{-19}~{\rm C}$) a distance $d = \SI{1}{\angstrom}$ away from the plane initially, the work done to move it to $\infty$ is
\begin{eqnarray}
    \eqbox{ W \approx 7.2~{\rm eV} }
.\end{eqnarray}

\sol{

(a) We have addressed the problem of a charge outside the sphere and solved by placing an image charge inside the sphere.
In this case, we just reverse the role of the charge and image charges.
The potential inside the sphere is therefore
\begin{eqnarray}
    \eqbox{ \Phi(\va*{r}) = \frac{1}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \Bigg[ \frac{q}{|\va*{r} - \va*{b}|} + \frac{q'}{|\va*{r} - \va*{b}'|} \Bigg] }
,\end{eqnarray}
where $q' = -(b/a) q$ and $\va*{b}' = (a/b)^2 \va*{b}$.

(b) We can find the induced surface-charge density from the electric field, which is 
\begin{eqnarray}
    \va*{E} = \frac{q}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \Bigg[ \frac{\va*{r} - \va*{b}}{| \va*{r} - \va*{b} |^3} - \frac{b}{a} \frac{\va*{r} - \va*{b}'}{| \va*{r} - \va*{b}' |^3} \Bigg] = \frac{q}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \Bigg[ \frac{\va*{r} - \va*{b}}{|\va*{r} - \va*{b}|^3} - \frac{b}{a} \frac{\va*{r} - (a/b)^2 \va*{b}}{|\va*{r} - (a/b)^2 \va*{b}|^3} \Bigg]
.\end{eqnarray}



is found from the potential as
\begin{eqnarray}
    \eqbox{
    \begin{aligned} 
        \sigma &= -\epsilon_0 \pdv{\Phi}{r} = \epsilon_0 = -\epsilon_0 \pdv{r} \frac{q}{4 \pi \epsilon_0} \Bigg[ \frac{1}{\sqrt{r^2 + b^2 - 2 r b \cos{\theta}}} - \frac{b}{a} \frac{1}{\sqrt{r^2 + b'^2 + 2 r b' \cos{\theta}}} \Bigg] \\
               &= -\frac{q}{4 \pi} \Bigg[ \frac{2 (r - b\cos{\theta})}{[r^2 + b^2 - 2rb \cos{\theta}]^{3/2}} - \frac{b}{a} \frac{2 (r + b' \cos{\theta})}{[r^2 + b'^2 + 2rb' \cos{\theta}]^{3/2}} \Bigg] \\
               &= -\frac{q}{2 \pi} \Bigg[ \frac{r - b\cos{\theta}}{[r^2 + b^2 - 2rb\cos{\theta}]^{3/2}} - \frac{b}{a} \frac{r + (a^2/b) \cos{\theta}}{[r^2 + a^{4}/b^2 - 2 r (a^2/b) \cos{\theta}]^{3/2}} \Bigg]
    .\end{aligned}
